"""Cleave web app: upload → background job → routed, explainable knowledge units.

The composition root, and nothing else. This file was 540 lines holding the job
model, disk persistence, the whole ingest→chunk→enrich orchestration and every
route; those live in ``cleave.pipeline`` and ``cleave.web`` now. What stays here
is what an entry point is for: build the app, mount the static files, register
the routers, and start the server.

Still deliberately small underneath: a module-level job dict and FastAPI
``BackgroundTasks``. Jobs run in seconds and the artifacts land on disk as JSON;
nothing here needs a queue, a database, or cancellation.
